# HistoryMaps
An educational webapp game that aims to convey in a fun manner some of the major events in military history. Utilises Javascript/jQuery (Google Maps API), PHP and MySQL

The very first live version of the History Maps Web App game. Severe limitations however, include non-responsive design layout and over-reliance on absolute positioning. 
Required to take course on advanced CSS concepts to enable re-design and facelift. See SASS and master branches for later versions.
