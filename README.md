# HistoryMaps
An educational webapp game that aims to convey in a fun manner some of the major events in military history. Utilises Javascript/jQuery (Google Maps API), PHP and MySQL

The SASS branch represents a local test version of the webapp game - notably, CSS is compiled from scss partials using the sass pre-processor. This approach is used to break CSS code into smaller bite-size chunks which are easier to manage and maintain. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance.
