The British engaged in a frontal assault in an effort to push the French from the ridge's summit. After 2 hours of fighting and three failed assaults, the British were eventually successful.

French casualties amounted to 2000, while British and Portugese were calculated as 720. Unfortunately Wellesley was not able to capitalise on the victory as he was superseded by the overly-cautious Sir Harry Burrard. The Convention of Sintra was signed, allowing the British to occupy Lisbon but the French to be shipped by the British Navy back to France with all of their guns, supplies and plunder. Wellesley was recalled to London to face judgement for such a generous agreement, along with his superiors Burrard and Sir Hew Dalrymple. Since Wellesley opposed the agreemnent he was exonerated from blame..."

Marshal Soult was left to dispatch the British at La Coruna, however despite the fall of Moore in this engagement, the British army was successfully evacuated. On Wellesley's return in April 1809, the French under Soult and Victor had failed to capitalise and Lisbon remained unoccupied. Wellesley divided his force into three: 12,000 were put under Mackenzie's command to protect Lisbon, 6,000 were handed to Beresford with orders to prevent Soult from joining with Victor, while Wellesley led the remaining 18,000 to face Soult at Oporto.",
      "aftermath": "The British were able to outflank the unprepared Marshal Soult by crossing the River Douro in a series of wine barges and then take occurpation and fortify a Bishop's seminary East of the city. The approach to the seminary were also within range of three artillery batteries positioned on the south side of the river by Wellesley. Failed attacks on the seminary by Soult forced him to release men guarding the quayside of Oporto town. Local boatmen as such were free to ferry more British troops across and ultimately force Soult to retire from the city."

However, due to the Spanish general's gross incompetence and failure to show, an initial opoortunity to crush the outnumbered French was spurned on July 23rd. As such, the French were greatly reinforced and the British and Spanish forced back to a defensive line on a 5km front north of Talavera.",

Although almost successful, these ultimately failed and Joseph retired from the battlefield leaving Victor to hold a defensive position. French casualties at Talavera totalled 7,300. Wellesley's losses of 5,400 were more than 25% of his entire force and, with a fresh army under Soult threatening to cut his lines of communication, he was compelled to withdraw his army towards Portugal and safety."

French losses on the day amounted to more than 4,600 killed, wounded or taken prisoner. British-Portuguese casualties totalled just 1,252. By the time French cavalry had discovered a road North of the ridge to outflank the British position, Wellington had already retreated to the heavily defended lines of Torres Vedras."

In response, Wellington deployed 34,000 infantry, 1,850 cavalry and 48 guns along a defensive line extending south from the ruins of Fort Concepcion to the village of Fuentes de Onoro. On the early afternoon of 3rd May, Massena launched a direct assault against Fuentes de Onoro.",

      "background": "Wellington began the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo on 8th January 1812, desperate to conclude the business before he could be interrupted by the French armies under Marmont or Dorsenne. Although a formidable fortress and well defended, its weakness was the proximity of two hills that could be armed with suitably placed siege artillery batteries. However, the larger of these hills was guarded by a French fort, Reynaud Redoubt - on the Greater Teson; it would have to be taken quickly if Wellington's siege was to be successful.",
      "aftermath":"After capturing the Redoubt on the 8th, siege batteries opened fire on the northern angle of the town's walls on the 14th. By the 19th, two breaches had been made on the town walls and despite their steepness, Wellington ordered an assault that same evening. Unfortunately beyond the main breach was located a large ditch, flanked and guarded either side by two guns. These were taken at bayonet-point but at the cost of heavy casualties. As the French defenses crumbled a large mine underneath the main breach was detonated by the French, with Maj.-Gen. Henry Mackinnon amongst those killed by the blast. The assault at the lesser breach cost the life of Maj.-Gen. Robert Crauford. British and Portuguese casualties from the start of the siege totalled 1,121 killed, wounded and missing of which 562 were accounted for during the storm itself. French casualties totalled around 530 killed or wounded - mostly in the assault - with a further 1,360 unwounded taken prisoner."

Although the allies possessed 27,000 men and the French garrison only 5000,  under General Philippon, the town commander, Badajoz possessed much stronger fortifications than either Almeida or Ciudad Rodrigo.",
      "aftermath":"By 25th March, batteries were firing on the outer walls of the fortress. Capture of strategically important outer fortresses enabled heavier breaching batteries to be put in place and by April 5th three breaches had been made in the curtain wall. At 22:00 April 6th, it was ordered that storming of the breaches should commence. However, the British met with strong resistance and in just under two hours, some 2,000 men had been killed or badly wounded at the main breach. However, Picton's 3rd division managed to scale the wall and secure a foothold within the main castle which enabled other factions of Wellington's army to link up and undermine the fortress defenses.  Seeing that he could no longer hold out, General Philippon withdrew from Badajoz to the neighbouring outwork of San Cristobal; however, he surrendered shortly after the town had fallen."

      "aftermath":"Marmont attempted on the 22nd July to outflank Wellington's army by pushing his leading divisions Westwards. Wellington had guarded against this by holding some of his units further back. As such they were able to turn on the exposed French divisions and inflict heavy casualties, ably supported by a destructive heavy British cavalry charge under Le Marchant. Although the eastern French divisions counter-attacked, this was swiftly broken and the battle ended with a general British-Portugese advance from the north and west. Wellington's army of 48,600 suffered 5,200 casualties but inflicted in the region of 14,000 casualties on Marmont's 50,000-strong army."

Unfortunately for Wellington, the leader of the French garrison, General of Brigade Jean-Louis Dubreton, led a masterful defense, thwarting Wellington's assaults time after time. With large French relief armies approaching Burgos from the northeast and Madrid from the southeast, Wellington withdrew to the west, abandoning large areas of Spain that had been recently liberated. During the withdrawal to Portugal the Anglo-Portuguese army lost many men to pursuing French cavalry and starvation. "

In contrast, Napoleon withdrew much of his army stationed in Spain to re-build that which was lost to the devastating Russian winter of 1812. By 20 May 1813 Wellington marched 79,000 (57,000 British, 16,000 Portuguese and 8,000 Spanish) troops northwards towards Burgos without allowing Joseph's French armies to concentrate. From Burgos, Wellington out-manoeuvred Joseph by wheeling through the mountains to the north. On 19th June, Joseph's combined force of 66,000 began to take up a defensive position west of the town of Vitoria.",
      "aftermath":"The French position was enclosed to the south by the Heights of Puebla and to the west and north by the Zadorra river. Joseph deployed his forces in three parallel lines facing west, the expected direction of attack. Wellington had no intention to confront the French head-on and thus divided his forces to enable serveral well-coordinated attacks. Under immense pressure on multiple fronts, the French position became hopeless and were forced into headlong retreat. Wellington's casualties from the battle amounted to 5,100. Joseph suffered not only 8,000 casualties but also the loss of virtually all his artillery and transport as well as 'the loot of a kingdom'. It is estimated that more than 1 million pounds of booty (perhaps 100 million pounds in modern equivalent) was seized"

Napoleon chose to attack and break each army separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. This plan almost worked, with the Prussians badly mauled at Ligny and the British forced into a fighting retreat after the battle at Quatras Bras on June 16th. Wellington retreated to Waterloo, offering battle  on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment, across the Brussels road. The Prussians withdrew in parallel, drawing part of the French army away to offer battle at Wavre.",
      "aftermath":"On learning that the Prussians would support him, Wellington offered battle and withstoood throughout the afternoon repeated attacks by the French. These incuded the siege of Hougoumont, the intial French infantry attack commanded by Count d'Erlon upon the weakest section of Wellington's line, the repeated French cavalry attacks on Wellington's centre and the loss of La Haye Sainte and subsequent close-range artillery bombardment of the exposed British infantry squares. However, the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements on Napoleon's right flank at Plancenoit relieved pressure on Wellington's centre significantly. As such, Napoleon was forced into a last desperate gamble, throwing his hitherto undefeated Imperial Guard against Wellington's centre. Rising from the reverse slope behind, the British infantry narrowly beat back the guard. As such and with the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre and the French army was routed."
