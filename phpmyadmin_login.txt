Seems like database is attached to https://drcrittall-mattcrittall.c9users.io/
If change apache root to https://drcrittall-mattcrittall.c9users.io/drcrittall/historymaps/public/index.php then can no longer access 
phpmyadmin...

Likewise, if stop apache then can no longer access database full-stop....

Other option is to move index.php to apache root, which is what I have done for this workspace
